# Lab 1: Assembly Language Programming Review

Lab Instructions
 *   This lab activity comprises two parts, namely Lab tasks, and Post-Lab Viva session. 
 *   Each group to upload completed lab report on LMS for grading.
 *   The students will start lab task and demonstrate each lab task separately for step-wise evaluation
 *   There are related questions in this activity give complete answers. Also provide complete code and results

**Objective:** The aim of this lab is to revise / learn Assembly Language instructions.

**Lab Task 1:**
 
 Define three arrays to hold five one-byte integers each. Initialize the first two with the numbers: 2,3,4,5,6,  and 3,4,5,6,7.Use  nested loop to multiply  corresponding  elements  of  arrays using addition. Display the resultant array using dumpmem and use Push and POP to save loop count (Note:  2*3=2+2+2, )

#### CODE:
```
INCLUDE Irvine32.inc
.data
array1 BYTE 2,3,4,5,6
array2 BYTE 3,4,5,6,7
array3 BYTE 5 DUP(0)
.code
main PROC
mov ecx, lengthof array1
mov ebx, OFFSET array2
mov esi, OFFSET array1
mov edi, OFFSET array3
L1:
push ecx
mov ecx, [ebx]
mov eax, 0
L2:
add eax, [esi]
loop L2
mov [edi], eax
inc edi
inc esi
inc ebx
pop ecx
loop L1
mov esi,OFFSET array3
mov ecx,LENGTHOF array3
mov ebx,TYPE array3
call DumpMem
exit
main ENDP
END main

```
**Lab Task 2:**
 
 Write and execute Assembly code for following program.
Take integer from user and calculate its factorial if input integer is between 3 and 5 output error statement and exit.(Note: Make use of  conditional jumps)

#### CODE:
```
TITLE Factorial calculator
INCLUDE Irvine32.inc
.data
msg1 byte "Enter the number of which factorial found: ", 0
msg2 byte "Factorial: ", 0
msg3 byte "Number is not between 3 and 5", 0
.code
main PROC
mov edx, offset msg1 ; moving offset of msg1 for printing
call writestring ;Print msg1 string
call  Readint ; taking input from user
cmp eax, 3
jnl L2
L2:
cmp eax, 5
jg L3

factorial:
mov ecx, eax ;moving user input to ecx as counter
mov eax, 0001h ; initialize eax with 1
L1:
  mul ecx
  loop L1
mov edx, offset msg2 ; moving offset of msg2 for printing
call writestring ; Print string
call writedec ;Print factorial
exit

L3:
mov edx, offset msg3 ; moving offset of msg2 for printing
call writestring ; Print string
exit
main ENDP
END main


```
**Lab Task 3:**
 
Write and execute assembly code to get 32 bit Hex number from user using ReadHex and find number oneâ€™s in 32 bit hex number using bit wise operations and display your count.

#### CODE:
```
INCLUDE Irvine32.inc
.data
msg1 byte "Enter a 32-bit hexadecimal number: ", 0
msg2 byte "Number of ones in 32-bit hex number: ", 0

.code
main proc
mov edx, offset msg1
call writestring ;Print msg1 string
call readhex     ; taking hexadecimal input from user

mov cx, 32;      ; loop for 32-bit binary number
mov ebx,0;

L1:
   shr eax,1     ; shift right the binary number 1 bit
   jnc zero      ; jump if bit is zero
   inc bl        ; increment if the bit is 1
zero: loop L1

mov edx, offset msg2
call writestring
mov eax,ebx
call writedec
main endp

END main


```
